           🏦 ATM Management System using Python
📌 Project Overview:

This project is a console-based ATM Management System developed using Python.
It simulates the working of a real ATM and focuses mainly on the backend logic such as authentication, transaction handling, validation, and receipt generation.

The project is designed at a beginner level, using simple and readable Python code to help students understand how real-world systems can be implemented using core programming concepts.

🎯 Purpose of the Project:

The main objective of this project is to:

Understand how an ATM system works internally

Practice backend logic using Python

Apply basic programming concepts in a real-life scenario

Build confidence in writing structured and logical code

⚙️ Features:

Language selection (English / Hindi)

4-digit ATM PIN verification with 3 attempt limit

Domestic and International transaction modes

Balance inquiry

Cash withdrawal (Savings, Current, Credit Card)

Cash deposit

Money transfer

OTP-based PIN generation and PIN change

Transaction receipt with current IST date & time

Proper validation for wrong PIN, wrong OTP, and insufficient balance

🧠 Backend Logic (Core Focus):

This project mainly focuses on the backend part of an ATM system, including:

User authentication (PIN and OTP validation)

Transaction processing logic

Balance updates after every transaction

Handling different transaction scenarios

Managing user flow using conditional statements and loops

A Python dictionary is used as a temporary backend database to store account details such as balance, PIN, OTP, and transaction history.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python 3

Built-in Python modules:

datetime (for date and time in receipt)

No external libraries or frameworks are used, making the project easy to understand for beginners.

📚 Concepts Used:
Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Loops (while)

Dictionaries

User input handling

Basic validation logic

Console-based interaction

🧪 Project Level:

Level: Beginner

Type: Backend logic simulation

Interface: Console-based

Use Case: Academic / learning purpose
