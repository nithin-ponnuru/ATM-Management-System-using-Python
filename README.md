🏦 ATM Management System using Python

A console-based ATM Management System developed using Python that simulates real-world ATM operations such as PIN verification, cash withdrawal, deposit, money transfer, and receipt generation. The system also supports bilingual interaction (English & Hindi) and displays real-time IST date and time on transaction receipts.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how core Python programming concepts can be applied to model a real ATM workflow.
It follows the same steps a user experiences at an actual ATM—from card insertion and language selection to secure transactions and receipt printing.

The project is beginner-friendly, exam-safe, and suitable for academic mini-projects.
